# GenevaERS-Grammar
ANTLR grammar files for the GenevaERS projects.

The listeners are consumed by the Sycadas project of the workbench.  
The visitors are used by the Compilers project of the Run Control Generator.

They are here in their own project in order to keep the grammar above projects in sync.
It is essential they both use the same grammar definitions.
